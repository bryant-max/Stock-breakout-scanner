Account Information. When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and optionally your phone number. This information is required to provide you with access to the Service.

Brokerage Connection Data. If you link a brokerage account via SnapTrade, we receive and store connection metadata (such as account names and identifiers) returned by SnapTrade. We do not store your brokerage credentials, login passwords, or API keys directly. All brokerage authentication is handled by SnapTrade.

Market Data Queries. We log symbols and scan parameters you query in order to improve AI models and to maintain the AI knowledge base. Query logs are associated with your account.
